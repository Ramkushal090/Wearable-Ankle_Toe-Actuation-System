# Wearable-Ankle_Toe-Actuation-System
This project presents an initial feasibility evaluation and design of a wearable ankle_toe actuation system, focusing on localized mechanical simulations of the ankle and toe. The proposed system combines stepper_motor_driven ankle actuation with five independently controlled servo motors to move each individual toe.
